Somewhere in the way in the middle of my loneliness
Feeling strange in the house of a mutual friend
I said, "Nope, thank you though, you know I don't do cocaine"
My thoughts are boring
You can ignore me
If you wanna fall in love in a bar tonight
Do you wanna fall in love with a broken heart?
Do you wanna ride? Ride in my Mirage?
Do you wanna be the one that feels the "Boom-Boom" back?
The "Boom-Boom" back
The "Boom-Boom" back
The "Boom-Boom" back
Once upon a time in the middle of an XL lie
Faking laughs, melted ice, throwing dollars and dice
Do you wanna step aside a hologram of your life?
Life is waiting in the middle of an XL lie
If you wanna fall in love in a bar tonight
Do you wanna fall in love with a broken heart?
Do you wanna ride? Ride in my Mirage?
Do you wanna be the one that feels the "Boom-Boom" back?
The "Boom-Boom" back
The "Boom-Boom" back
Feels the "Boom-Boom" back
(Woo)
We went to this after party, and they were staring at us
"Tia, ¿Se nota tanto que somos españolas?"
"Maybe sí, maybe no"
"I don't know why we came"
Oh, oh, she was like
"Girl, you guys are so funny, you guys are so cute"
Do you wanna fall in love?
Do you wanna feel the "Boom-Boom" back?
If you wanna fall in love in a bar tonight
Do you wanna fall in love with a broken heart?
Do you wanna ride? Ride in my Mirage?
Do you wanna be the one that feels the "Boom-Boom" back?
The "Boom-Boom" back
The "Boom-Boom" back
Ah-ah, that feels the "Boom-Boom" back
(Ah) The "Boom-Boom" back
That is "Boom-Boom" back
That feels the "Boom-Boom" back
